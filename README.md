#### INSTALLATION

Clone the [repository](https://github.com/jonmkoenig/microscripts) and add it to your path. On Windows I usually clone directly to 'C:\Program Files' -- on Unix systems I would clone to my home directory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jokocide/Microscripts.git
```

Update your path to include the new Microscripts directory.

I focus on developing the scripts in Powershell and BASH primarily, but I sometimes create a python alternative as well. Delete the directories that are not relevant to you.

#### USAGE

After adding the Microscripts directory to your path, you can type out the name of the script (ex. cloak.ps1) to perform the function.
